# Classification of Baybayin Handwritten Images using a Convolutional Neural Network

This demonstrates how to implement the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize the Baybayin (a pre-colonial script used by Filipinos) handwritten symbols from images. Please note that the hyperparameters of this model are not optimized.
