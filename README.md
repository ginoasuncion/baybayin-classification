# Classification of Baybayin Handwritten Images using a Convolutional Neural Network

This is a repository containing the implementation of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that can recognize the Baybayin (a pre-colonial script used by Filipinos) handwritten symbols from images. Please note that as of now the hyperparameters of this model is not yet optimized.
